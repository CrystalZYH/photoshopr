# Site

## Notes

* It’s high-quality shop of PS plugins
* Ideal: instead of looking up in the internet, just go to photoshopr.com
* Name: Photoshop crutches. Pimp my PS. Photoshop stuff for web-developer. Prepare PS for web-dev.

## Ideas

* Icons with PS target version / program: even not PS, but AI, Sketch, etc
* Show prices of plugins / filter by free
* Tags = tasks of plugins
* Download collection / set of plugins (as cart)
* Analogs of photoshop
* Generic font packs
* Plugins for ai/fw/...
* Reflect part of design process (even as infographics): design, prototyping, mockups, 
* Plugins similar to this one

## Business ideas

* Only quality stuff
* Set discounts (download 5 for the price of 3)
* Partnership with plugin maintainers
* Paid placement (2 best plugins, rest - paid)
* RU version
* Photoshop seller/satellite
* Promote photoshopr plugin (SVG, CSS)
* Web-developer pack of plugins/ web-designer / illiustrator


## Analysis of competitors

* [Photoshoplr](http://madebyvadim.tumblr.com/)
	+ Replete with plugins
	- You cannot see all aplugins in one page. Too long to flip all over the pages.
	- You cannot filter free ones
	- You cannot download/buy easily
	- You do not see exact action plugin takes
	- You cannot download initial webdeveloper pack at once
	- You don’t see versions / type / OS / category

* [Photoshop panels](http://pspanels.com/)
	+ Similar plugins on the page of plugin
	+ Preview of actual panel, not just branding image
	+ Search
	+ Big non-slider preview on the page of specific post
	- Not much of plugins
	- No useful navigation

## Requirements

* Plugins shots should be better than dribble ones (better than the best of dribbles)
* Plugin review pages should be better than the bets plugins’ ones.
* First impression should be as fully credible, full up with content site
* Last impression should be as bright, clear, light, scrupulously made and pleasant site. As Birman’s designs, as gorbunov designs.
* There should not be any questions on the page about how or why does it work that way.
* 

## Scenarious

* Find exact plugin (somewhen saw it, but do not remember name, just category)
* Explore all set of cool PS tools
*
