* Ideal: instead of looking up in the internet, just go to photoshopr.com

## Ideas

* Download collection / set of plugins (as cart)
* Analogs of photoshop

## Business ideas

* Partnership with plugin maintainers
* Paid placement (2 best plugins, rest - paid)
* RU version
* Photoshop seller/satellite
* Promote photoshopr plugin (SVG, CSS)
* Web-developer pack of plugins/ web-designer / illiustrator
